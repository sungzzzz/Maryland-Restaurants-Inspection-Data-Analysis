# Maryland-Restaurants-Inspection-Data-Analysis

### I used data of restaurants inspection around Maryland area to search for insights of various kinds of violations such as the peak time of violations in a year and the most common type of violations. I used different techniques such as creating dummies, pivoting data and converting time data etc to simplize the analysis. I also adapted plotly interactive chart and map in order to make results easier to understand.
